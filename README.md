# BarclaysUnofficialBankingApp
Unofficial Barclays internet banking application

## System Requirements: 

Operating System: Android (Tested on Huawei P800 running android marshmallow version 6.0.1 rooted)

## Usage
I created this app due to the restrictions on the Barclays official app not allowing use on a rooted device. The only alternative is the Barclays web app which unfortuantely provides no way to quickly login without filling in multiple security forms.This app provides a simple to use mobile banking app which automates the login process.

###Features include
Automated login to the web app using javascript injection.

An internal database to store and retrieve sensitive data for the login fields.

Password protection front end which requires a 5 digit passcode in order to login.

Add/Remove Account and set security pin 


## Note
Although this application does work as intended be warned that this app saves sensitive data on your OS (sql database) which of course is far from ideal practice in terms of security.
